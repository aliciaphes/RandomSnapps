This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3. and uses Bootstrap.

# Instructions
In order for the app to work, you will need to create a JSON file called keys.json (this file could also be in the server but for simplicity we read it locally). Store this file under the 'assets' folder. The content should be like this:<br/>

    {
    "APP_ACCESS_KEY": "your access key",
    "APP_SECRET": "your secret"
    }

## Development server

Run `npm install` and then `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
