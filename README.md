This app has been created using Angular and Bootstrap.

# Instructions
In order for the app to work, you will need to create a JSON file called keys.json (this file could also be in the server but for simplicity we read it locally). Store this file under the 'assets' folder. The content should be like this:<br/>

    {
    "APP_ACCESS_KEY": "your access key",
    "APP_SECRET": "your secret"
    }

Then you just need to run `npm install` and `ng serve` as with any Angular app.
